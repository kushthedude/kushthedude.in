Hey! I'm Kush, a software engineer based in Indore, IN.

I am a final year computer science undegraduate student at [IIT, Jodhpur](https://www.iitj.ac.in). I have been involved in open-source projects for more than a year and have contributed to various top notch organisations like CNCF, OpenRefine, Layer5 & Fossasia.
